<!--
Basic frontend for displaying the structure of the binary data from the Rust code.

This needs:

     - the Json output of the Rust code to be in ./test.json
     - an HTTP server to be running with the 'frontend' directory as its root
       - e.g. with Python, you can run `python -m http.server`
     - a browser, obviously
